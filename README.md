# 🚀 StreamSync & InfluenceIQ

## 📌 Overview
Welcome to our hackathon project! This repository contains two groundbreaking solutions:

1. **StreamSync** - A scalable and cost-efficient streaming platform that ensures synchronized video playback for millions of users with zero lag.
2. **InfluenceIQ** - An AI-powered ranking system that fairly measures the credibility, longevity, and engagement of public figures, preventing fake fame and manipulation.

# 🎬 StreamSync

## 🔥 Problem Statement
Streaming giants struggle to handle massive concurrent viewers without lag. Our goal is to build a system where:
- Users see the exact video they are supposed to be watching, no matter when they join.
- Millions of personalized streams run concurrently without buffering.
- Compute and storage costs are optimized while maintaining performance.

## 🏗️ Solution Approach
✅ **Pre-stored & Pre-calculated Content** - Videos are pre-sequenced for users.
✅ **Global Sync Mechanism** - Users joining at different times will see the correct part of their personalized sequence.
✅ **AI-Powered Caching & Load Balancing** - Predictive caching and auto-scaling ensure smooth playback.
✅ **Efficient Storage & Compute Optimization** - Smart segmentation of video chunks reduces storage costs.
✅ **CDN Integration** - Geographically distributed servers improve latency and performance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, WebSockets
- **Database**: MongoDB, Redis (for caching)
- **Streaming**: HLS (HTTP Live Streaming), FFmpeg
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow (for predictive caching and optimization)
- **Cloud & Deployment**: AWS S3, CloudFront, Docker, Kubernetes

# 🌟 InfluenceIQ

## 🔥 Problem Statement
Current popularity metrics focus on short-term trends rather than long-term influence. Our system ranks public figures based on:
- **Credibility & Trustworthiness**
- **Fame Longevity**
- **Meaningful Engagement**

## 🏗️ Solution Approach
✅ **AI-Based Sentiment Analysis** - NLP-based credibility scoring using real-time data.
✅ **Fraud Detection** - AI detects fake followers, spam reviews, and manipulated engagement.
✅ **Dynamic Influence Score** - A real-time scoring system adjusts rankings based on sustained relevance.
✅ **Ethical AI & Privacy Measures** - Ensuring unbiased evaluation and data security.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI), Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Firebase (for real-time updates)
- **AI/ML**: Hugging Face, OpenAI GPT, Scikit-learn
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Cloud & Deployment**: AWS Lambda, Docker, Kubernetes

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install  # For StreamSync backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For InfluenceIQ backend
   ```
3. Start the backend servers:
   ```sh
   npm run dev  # StreamSync
   python app.py  # InfluenceIQ
   ```
4. Run the frontend:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

## 🌍 Deployment
Both services are containerized using Docker and deployed on Kubernetes clusters for scalability.
